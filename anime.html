    <p>My dad and I took a guys trip to Japan. We ate tons of my favorites ramen, udon, and sushi. Then we went to the famous Akihabara Crossing in Tokyo... it was like the heavens opened! Akihabara has 10 floors filled with shops specializing in anime, manga (anime comic books), and video games!</p>
