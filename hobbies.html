  <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>Cooking</h2>
      <p>Normally I make the family Sunday dinner. Last week, we had herb encrusted grilled spare ribs with fresh baked rolls.</p>

    <h2>Traveling</h2>
      <p>I love the snow. Unfortunately, I live in California, so I don't see it until ski season. I like playing in the snow, but it would get pretty old if the temperature was always in the mid-teens and single digits.</p>

	  <p>One of my most memorable travel was going to Hobbiton. The director, Sir Peter Jackson, was so detailed in the creation of "The Shire". This tree is actually fake. It's made out of fiberglass and the leaves are made out of silk, which were attached one by one. If the leaves started to fade, Sir Peter Jackson had them hand painted back to its correct color.</p>

    <h2>Coding</h2>
      <p>I have been coding for 3 years. Coding to me is like solving a big jigsaw puzzle, where there's a reward at the end. I'm sharing with you something I coded last year. Also, based on our professor's strict instructions, I am just sharing the stripped out version and pure html.</p>
