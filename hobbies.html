    <h2>Traveling</h2>
      <h3>I love the snow. Unfortunately, I live in California, so I don't see it until ski season. I like playing in the snow, but it would get pretty old if the temperature was always in the mid-teens and single digits.</h3>

	  <h3>One of my most memorable travels was going to visit Hobbiton. The directo, Sir Peter Jackson, was so detailed in the creation of "The Shire", that this tree is fake. It's made out of fiberglass and the leaves are made out of silk, which were attached one by one onto the tree. If the leaves started to fade, Sir Peter Jackson had them hand painted.</h3>

    <h2>Coding</h2>
      <h3>I have been coding for 3 years. Coding to me is like solving a big jigsaw puzzle, where it's so rewarding at the end. I'm sharing with you something I coded last year. Also, based on our professor's strict instructions, I am just sharing the stripped out version and pure html. </h3>
